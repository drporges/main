# Your hero!

## Objective

I want you to make up a website about someone you look up to!  I don't need JS, I just want you guys to have an opportunity to style/create your hearts out.  

### Requirements

- A not ugly page

- Maybe some pictures, resized (save them to your local and link to them using relative pathing)

- Include multiple colors!!


### Challenge

- Don't even write ANYTHING on the HTML, besides links to the JS + CSS

- Try appending everything via jQuery.  

```
const para1 = $("<p>This is my first paragraph!</p>");
$('body').append($para1);
```
