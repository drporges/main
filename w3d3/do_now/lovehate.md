# Do Now

## Love/Hate!

Yesterday was a bit of a struggle for all of us!  Let's vent a little bit. 

### Objectives

- I want you to create a page where you list some of the things that you love!  You can include whatever you want, and I'd like for you to style a little bit too!

- On button click, I want you to execute a function that will replace the things you love with the things you hate!  Change all of your relevant text!

- You can also toggle the styles to change the 'mood' of the page! 

- Be creative :)

### Challenge!

- You start with a not filled-in HTML page (you can set up the skeleton + set up the HTML tags you'd want to use).  

- Your button, instead of just launching toggleHate(), launches a toggler() function that, based on the # of clicks you have, executes either a toggleLove() and a toggleHate().  

```
toggler(){
	if(clicks are even){
		toggleLove()
	} else {
		toggleHate()
	}
}
```

- Insert HTML via innerHTML!
