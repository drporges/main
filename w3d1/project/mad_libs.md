# Mini Project: Mad-libs!

## Project Objectives:
- Use text fields to create a story!


“For this project, we are going to do Mad Libs. If you haven’t played Mad Libs before, it is a story that has blanks in it. The player fills in the blanks, without knowing what the story is. Then, the player reads the story with their words filling in the blanks. We are going to use JavaScript to create the same game. The way we do it, is by having our players fill out text fields, then pressing the Finish button to show the full story.”

I want this project to be styled so that it's not ugly!

Use google to find a mad lib you personally enjoy, then make it happen!

You might want to think of the project where you have all your input boxes in one ```<div>```, and your expected output in another ```<div>```.  

```element.style.visibility = 'hidden';      // Hide```
```element.style.visibility = 'visible';     // Show```

Toggle these on the click of a button (maybe you'll need a reset button?)
